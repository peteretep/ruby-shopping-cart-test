You have been asked to model a shopping basket.  We must be able to:

* Add items to the shopping basket
* Remove items from the shopping basket
* Empty the shopping basket

Additionally, we must be able to calculate the total of the shopping basket accounting for:

* Buy-one-get-one-free discounts on items
* 10% off on totals greater than Â£20 (after bogof)
* 2% off on total (after all other discounts) for customers with loyalty cards.

There is no requirement to create a GUI but we must be able to see the code running or tests passing.
